# Week 14 - activity 2: Create a Decorator to Measure Execution Time
# Develop a Python project that uses the "time.sleep" method together with a decorator 
# to measure a function's execution time. Share your understanding via GitHub and explain 
# why we have used decorators and when we need to use them in your code as a comment.

import time

# WHAT IS A DECORATOR?
# A decorator is a function that modifies or extends the behavior of another function
# without changing the original function's code. It's like "wrapping" a function with extra functionality.


# WHEN TO USE DECORATORS?
# - Measure execution time (like in this example)
# - Log function calls
# - Validate input parameters
# - Cache results of expensive functions
# - Add authentication/authorization
# - Count how many times a function was called

    1. Captures the time before the function executes
    2. Executes the original function
